[*not another demo*](https://github.com/acfromspace/notanotherdemo) is a application with the following features:

- **Premise.** Create a game application that showcases artificial intelligence manuevers such as "Lazy Flight" and "Circle a Tree" behaviors. Also showcase networking capabilities so two players can coexist in the same environment from different computers.
- **Design.** A simple main menu that showcases each of the designs.
- **Future endeavors.** Showcasing more of the same, perhaps a game that learns the player's movements as the player goes through more designs to better enhance the machine learning.
